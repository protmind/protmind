## üåü About ProtMind
Welcome to **ProtMind**, a collaborative team developing **innovative tools** in **structural bioinformatics**.  

We integrate **conventional computational methods** with **AI and machine learning** to tackle challenges in:  
- Protein structure analysis  
- Molecular modeling  
- Drug discovery  
- Computational biology workflows  

Our **open-source projects, scripts, and pipelines** make bioinformatics more **accessible, efficient, and accurate** for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üß© [Python Batch Mutation Wizard (PyBMW)](https://github.com/protmind/Python-Batch-Mutation-Wizard-PyBmw)
A **PyMOL plugin** that automates **protein mutagenesis workflows**:  
- Single & batch mutation modes  
- CSV-driven high-throughput mutagenesis  
- Step-by-step and individual residue mutation modes  
- Export as PDB or PyMOL session files  

PyBMW is our flagship tool ‚Äî ProtMind is continuously developing **AI-powered pipelines** for molecular modeling, structural analysis, and protein engineering.
